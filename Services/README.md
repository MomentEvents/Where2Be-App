Hi there. This is our services folder. The purpose of the services folder is to 
have an organized way for us to centralize and reuse our backend calls while making 
it easy for us to debug any issues we have. You are more than welcome to write new
service functions if you see fit. Service functions do not always have to connect 
to our database (ie AuthService has functions which write tokens, validate, logout, 
etc.). They are used for reausability and readability.
